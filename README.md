# RosaFW
A open-source Mario framework for GMS 1.4.9999 and 2.x

# What is this?
RosaFW is a open-source Mario Bros 3 styled framework for Game Maker Studio 1.4 and 2.x<br />
The Framework was build using GMS 1.4 but is fully compatible with Studio 2.x.

# Why GMS 1.4?
A lot of people still use this version of GMS because it's faster and the UI isn't awful like GMS 2's.<br />
Additionally, it's very easy to find a "legit" copy of 1.4, while it's impossible for GMS 2.<br /><br />
"But Game Maker Studio 2 is free to use now, what do you mean?"<br /><br />
Well... yes but also not really. You can design your game in GMS 2 but you will *not* be able to export it in any form<br />
unless you pay for a subscription.<br /><br />
Anyways, if you own GMS 2, no worries, you will be able to utilize this framework just fine<br />
I designed it to work with both as easily as possible. So most code is in a seperate script so your codeblocks<br />
in GMS 2 don't look like an absolute mess.

# Why should I use this?
I dunno. Ask yourself that.<br /><br /><br /> 
Kiddin, you may prefer this over other Mario frameworks such as Gate's for it's much simpler and overall cleaner looking.<br />
It's also not filled with a lot of gimmicks. The main purpose of this framework is to give a template with all the basics. That's it.<br /><br />
No offense to Gate and others of course, but sometimes less is more.<br />.<br />
But if you are looking for something with more content, I recommend checking out https://github.com/GateteVerde/Gatete-Mario-Engine-9.

# What am I allowed to do with this?
I really don't care about that.<br /> Make your own Mario Maker, Hello's "The Shroom Project" clone or a remake of "Peachâ€™s Untold Tale "<br />
I could care less, just have fun doing something.<br /><br />
I'd appreciate credits for the framework though.

# Why is it called Rosa?
Cause Rosalina, and Rosalina = Best Princess.
